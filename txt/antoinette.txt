Marie's is a story of a charmed life and tragic death. What was her childhood like? How was her life with Louis XVI at Versailles and what caused her eventual downfall? And of course, what did she really look like?

Join us as we tell her story and reveal facial reconstructions with influences from portraits as well as the death mask of the ill-fated Last Queen of France.
